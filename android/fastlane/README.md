Check-in app example
----

# Installation

Install packages:

```sh
yarn
```

# Challenge

## The problem

Develop an app that 
offers a complete checkin experience to the worker. 

Feel free to create an experience that feels the most pleasant to the 
worker.

Users must be able to:

- View the store list;
- View all the tasks of a given store;
- Perform a checkin in a store/task.

## Walkthrough

- Use (preferentialy) react native for your application, avoiding Expo 
APIs usage;
- Use a state management solution if you need to;
- Try to use the most up to date Javascript features (ES6+);
- Write unit tests and any other tests you find helpful or important to 
have;
- Keep performance and corner cases in mind;
- Be creative and show us what you`ve got.

## The REST API

The API has two endpoints:

>- **GET** `/stores` - returns a list of stores with it`s tasks.
>- **POST** `/stores/reset` - reset state to initial values in stores. (**It is recommended to generate a local or cache status to maintain the stores scheme, the values of the online stores may be affected by other participants.**)

>- **POST** `/checkin` - performs a checkin in a store/task.
>
>     Parameters:  
>     - `storeId` - Number  
>     - `taskId` - Number  

## Bonus

- Animations are welcome! ü§© (Reanimated, SKIA, Lottie, etc)
- Show stores in some map view
- Calculate distance based on your actual location, to see which store is closest to me.
- Scripts for generate .ipa or .aab with fastlane or other tools.

## Delivery

- **Don't** fork this project. Create a new repository in your account and 
send us the URL;
- Create a README file with the instructions to run the project and the 
tests. Also add any comment that you think is relevant.

## What will be evaluated?

- Readability  
- Maintenance  
- Testability
- Libs usage (Feel free!)

Thanks and good luck! üçÄ
